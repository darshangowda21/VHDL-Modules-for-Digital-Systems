# VHDL-Modules-for-Digital-Systems
This repository contains foundational VHDL modication systems, including a D flip-flop (DFF), seven-segment display driver (sseg), and UART serial interface (uart). These modules are written in synthesizable VHDL and verified through simulation, making them ideal for digital design education, prototyping, or integration into more complex systems.
